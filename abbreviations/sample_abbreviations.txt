# dbdeployer looks for a file "abbreviations.txt" and treats every line
# as an abbreviation followed by its replacement.
# Then, it looks at the command line arguments.
# If an argument matches an abbreviation, it will be replaced by the replacement items.
# For example, the file contains this line:
# 	sbs sandboxes
# 
# when the user types "dbdeployer sbs", it will be replaced with "dbdeployer sandboxes"
# 
# A more interesting example:
# 	groupr replication --topology=group
# 
# Here, a command "dbdeployer groupr 8.0.4" becomes "dbdeployer deploy replication --topology=group 8.0.4"
# 
# It is also possible to set variables in the replacement.
#     sbdef --sandbox-directory={{.sb}} --port={{.port}}
# 
# To use this abbreviation, we need to provide the values for 'sb' and 'port'
# dbdeployer sbdef:port=9000,sb=mysandbox deploy single 8.0.4
# it will become  "dbdeployer --sandbox-directory=mysandbox --port=9000 deploy single 8.0.4
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# use as "dbdeployer group 5.7.21"
groupr deploy replication --topology=group

groupsp deploy replication --topology=group --single-primary
